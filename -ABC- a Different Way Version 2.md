#"ABC" a Different Way

###By Eric Talbot
----------
The *Jackson 5* have created some of the most iconic songs indicative to the pop genre including the hit "ABC." With the arrival of electro-dance-music and remixes, it was only a matter of time until another artist used it to create their own work. A DJ by the name of *Sigala* took this song and turned it into something else: **a new expression of art**. To compare the two for oneself here are the links:

 - ["ABC" by *Jackson 5*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho7796-au8U)

**Does *Sigala's* "Easy Love" remix violate copyright laws?** According to Chapter 17 of U.S. code 102, "Copyright protection subsists, in accordance with this title, in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression..." including musical works. "ABC" is protected under copyright law. "Easy Love" must, therefore, follow the restrictions/guidelines of **Fair Use** stated in Chapter 17 Code 107. 
###**The Defense of Fair Use includes:**
 1. the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
 2. the nature of the copyrighted work;
 3. the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
 4. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

###**The song is commercially used.**
The artist of "Easy Love" does have it available on iTunes, so you may purchase it.
###**The song also samples large portions of the original "ABC."**
The only lyrics in "Easy Love" are the main chorus of "ABC" repeating them throughout the song.

####Due to these two obvious realities, one can rule out the first and third points of **Fair Use** to build a case. Therefore, the second and fourth points will make up the defense against copyright infringement. 
###"The nature of the copyrighted work"
*Sigala* does use the "ABC" chorus throughout his song; however, he alters the tempo, volume, and clarity to create **a new work of art**. The chorus reads as, "ABC is easy it's like counting up to three. Sing a simple melody, that 's how easy love can be." Within "Easy Love," he noticeably increases the tempo at which the lyric is being sung. In addition to this he fades it in and out with the beats he created, changing the volume and clarity of the original lyric. This all accumulates to the genre that he plays into: **EDM**. Both the pop and EDM genres are catchy and easy to dance to, but like Andy Warhol's use of the tomato soup can, the mindless repetition of the same lyric changes the meaning of the thing that each artist is using. Warhol uses the soup can to elicit **a lack of personality and expression**. "Easy Love" too has taken something, a song lyric instead, and through its repetition it is devoid of meaning becoming literally a song to be danced to. Although that may not be what *Sigala* had intended, that is what songs of this nature are: **a tomato soup can of lyrics** (lacking meaning) forcing the audience to focus on the artist's symphony of beats.
###"The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work."
Finally "Easy Love" does not affect the market for the original "ABC." As stated before, the two songs are of **different genres appealing to different audiences**. Also "Easy Love" omits almost every lyric except for the chorus, so if people wanted to listen to "ABC" and bought *Sigala*'s song instead, they would surely be disappointed. The only voice one can hear in "Easy Love" is Michael Jackson's, leaving out the rest of the *Jackson 5*. 

##"Easy Love" is not copyright infringement.
####To make sure let's review the **Fair Use** defenses:
||Noncommercial Use| Nature of Use|Amount Used| Affected Market|
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Point Substantiated |---|x|---|x|
|Point Unsubstantiated|x|---|x|---|
Therefore, because "Easy Love" is an original form of artistic expression and does not affect the market/value of *Jackson 5*'s "ABC," the song is protected under **Fair Use** and does not violate copyright law.
